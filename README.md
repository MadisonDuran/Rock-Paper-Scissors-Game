Hello Latori!

This is my submission for Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Challenge | Guided Inquiry JavaScript (week 6) assignment.

Requirements Completed:
I successfully built a functional Rock, Paper, and Scissors game that includes all these features.

- I created a user interface with an input box that allows the user to type in “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors”.
- When the user clicks the “Play” button and the input is submitted, the input is validated and the computer randomly generates “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors” and displays it.
- The game compares the user’s choice with the computer's choice to determine who wins.
- Displays the result of the game with (e.g., "You win!", "Computer wins!", or "It's a tie!") on the web page.

Optional Challenges Completed:
In addition to creating a functionable game, I completed all optional features.

- I added a scoreboard that updated after each new game, tracking wins, losses, ties, and total games.
- I also created a reset button that fully clears the score and allows the user to start a new game.

Codebase includes:
- Pseudocode 
- Neat with consistent formatting
- Good naming conventions 
- Comments around functionality


Why I deserve a 4:
I deserve a 4 because I completed all of the requirements and I put in the extra effort to complete the optional challenges.
I created my first functionable game in Javascript, I made it interactive, user-friendly, and responsive. To enhance the user experience, I put a lot of effort into my CSS styling.
I used transitions, hover affects, and button animations to make my page stand out more. I added a full screen background image to give my page some personality. The layout of my page is responsive across all devices. 
I went above and beyond this week in self learning, watching Udemy videos for Javascript, doing my own research using the Mdm web docs website to help me learn how to declare my variables and write out my functions, 
and I used a codeacademy video just to help give me some pointers on how to make a functionable game in JavaScript. Some extra resources I used were the HTML and CSS validator to make sure I’m using best practices for
clean code. Throughout this assignment I have become more comfortable with html and css. Javascript is a language I’m still learning and improving on but it’s clear to understand when it’s broken down step by step.
This project helped me learn how html, css, and JavaScript all work together to create a webpage and I’m excited to learn more!

All the best, Madison
